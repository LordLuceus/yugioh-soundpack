# yugioh-soundpack
A Yu-Gi-Oh MUD Soundpack for the allinaccess.com MUD

# Configuration

This soundpack allows the user to configure its user experience and therefore adds the config command while in game.
Use it to your own advantage.

# Translation

This game actually supports multiple languages, which can be toggled by using the language command while in game. Since those languages are actually toggled server-side not not within the soundpack, we'll need to write triggers to support all the multilingual texts too.

Currently Engliash and German are supported, so if you want to see your language supported too and you know that the MUD actually supports it, don't hesitate to translate the texts which you can find inside the [english trigger file](./worlds/triggers/english.json) into that language and send us the result. We'll be happy to put them into the soundpack too.
