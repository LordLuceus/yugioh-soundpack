# yugioh-soundpack
A Yu-Gi-Oh MUD Soundpack for the allinaccess.com MUD

# Configuration

This soundpack allows the user to configure its user experience and therefore adds the config command while in game.
Use it to your own advantage.

# Translation

This game actually supports multiple languages, which can be toggled by using the language command while in game. Since those languages are actually toggled server-side not not within the soundpack, we'll need to write triggers to support all the multilingual texts too.

Currently English and German are supported, so if you want to see your language supported too and you know that the MUD actually supports it, don't hesitate to translate the texts which you can find inside the [english trigger file](./worlds/triggers/english.json) into that language and send us the result. We'll be happy to put them into the soundpack too.

# Licensing

My code can be used freely and can be used in any project, just as you wish. I'm even using several PlugIns from other developers who made their code free-to-use.

The sound effects used in this project are mainly grabbed from several Yu-Gi-Oh Games or from the anime series, but they will be exchanged one after another by sound effects licensed to my person. Same goes for the music used in this project, which is licensed to me. That means the following for you:
* If you intend to clone this project and want to modify the soundpack without the whish to merge your changes back into the main project, you'll have to change/remove all music tracks, as well as sound effects which are not used from the original anime series/Yu-Gi-Oh Games. If you continue using the stuff licensed to me and I detect that, i'm able to consult the lawyer due to copyright reasons. Same goes if you use the sounds and music used in this project for other projects which are unrelated to this soundpack in any way possible.
* If you intend to help me fix some stuff or add new stuff to the soundpack, but do not want to publish your soundpack version yourself, all those rules don't count for you.
